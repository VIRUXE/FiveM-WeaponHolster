# Weapon Holster
This resource is for people that use the [Overextended Inventory](https://github.com/overextended/ox_inventory) and want a more realistic mechanic for holstering weapons.
**Warning: I'm not using this Inventory anymore so feel free to fork it if you pretend to fix or extend it.**

It doesn't work for all weapons, but for those that work (heavy ones) you can set if you want them attached to the characters **Chest** or **Back** (check `client.lua`).

It also doesn't cancel the original inventory animation for storing and retrieving weapons. (Maybe sometime in the future?)

**Note:** In real life, you don't run around like GTA carrying multiple heavy weapons so only use this if you made adjustments for players to only carry one heavy weapon or if you don't care what type of weapon object gets attached. (If you carry more than one heavy weapon it will attach the one found first according to their names, in a ascending order.)

Thank you to [itshapp](https://github.com/itzhapp/ShowWeapon) for the weapon's table.
